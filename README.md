# VotingVest

## Goal

This project leverages multiple technical indicators to perform a **MAJORITY VOTE** and bruteâ€‘force all possible indicator combinations, backtests each strategyâ€™s performance, and then selects the best combination

- Backtesting: Calculates cumulative return, Sharpe ratio, win rate, total trades, maximum drawdown, etc.
- Decision Making: Generates a "Strong Buy", "Hold / Buy", or "Close / No Buy" recommendation for the current day based on the top-performing indicator combination. (Short-selling is not implemented; "Close" strictly means **CLOSING** any existing long position.)

## Prerequisites
- Python: Version 3.8 or higher
- Python Packages:
```
pip install pandas numpy yfinance TA-Lib matplotlib tqdm
```

### Other Breakouts and Momentum
- Donchian Channel (20â€‘period)**: Break above upper channel â†’ Buy; break below â†’ Close
- Keltner Channel (20â€‘period ATR)**: Break above upper channel â†’ Buy; break below â†’ Close
- ATR Breakout**: Close > previous close + ATR â†’ Buy; close < previous close - ATR â†’ Close
- Aroon Up/Down crossover** â†’ Buy/Close
- ROC (ROC_10)**: ROC > 0 â†’ Buy; ROC < 0 â†’ Close

## Usage
```
python strategy.py <ticker> <threads> <member>
```
- [ticker]: (required) stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOG)
- [threads]: (optional) number of worker processes for vote computation; default = 20.
- [member]: (optional) size of each indicator group (must be odd); default = 7.

### The script will:

1. Download historical data (all period) from Yahoo Finance
2. Compute all technical indicators
3. Generate signals via **MAJORITY VOTE** over all "odd-length" (specified by [member]) indicator combinations
4. Backtest each combinationâ€™s performance
5. Rank combinations using Minâ€‘Max normalization and select the top 3 (exclude the combinations with <5 trading counts)
6. Plot performance charts and output todayâ€™s recommendation based on the best combo

Happy backtesting and good luck with your trading insights! ðŸŽ¯
